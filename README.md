A mobile app for a motorcycle-taxi service

This very ambitious project was head-hammered by the accelerator we presented it in 2019 due to security and legislation. Even if they accepted us though i believe it would be pretty difficult to succeed for two reasons:

1) In my country you cant get a license for using a motorcycle as a taxi
2) Even if you could the car-taxi lobbies would shut you down as they did with Uber

The bootcamp we went through though was very useful in terms of bussiness and startup management. Anyway to the technicals:

This is an android app that was ment to use SQL, Google Maps and Stripe. I will write as much as i can remember from our plans and designs back then. We thought of either raising capital and building our fleet with employees or give the ability to anyone with a bike in a good condition be our driver. The drivers would press set their availability status and nearby users could call them, all through the app. Once the user reached the destination the app would calculate the price based on a time and distance formula. Im not gonna write the payment-safety details cause i neither remember them nor they are of use.

The application implemented a complete account system, with info, rating and media and i was designing the map and payment systems when we stopped it. I will post the logo screen below and you can download and build the project to see the rest if you like.
